The LSx Action Planner
===

## Beginners Guide
LSx works with schools and communities to monitor and take action on air pollution. They'd like to develop something that can digitalise and democratise data and information of air pollution.

```gherkin=
Feature: I don’t have data/haven’t done an experiment (yet)

  Scenario: I’m new to LSx and am keen to get involved
   Given I’d like to ‘see the invisible pollution’ so that I can get something done about it
    And provide info on data collection methods

 
  Scenario: I’d like to know the next steps so that I know what the best thing to do is
    Given SHARING is key
    And Experiments are a option but also ..
    And other people’s data
    
     Scenario: I’d like to see success stories so that I can feel confident/reassured/inspired
   And display stories where users falter
    
      Scenario: I’d like to connect with others locally so that I can share my findings and stay motivated
    Given hashtag on Twitter and Facebook?
    And groups in E/S/W/N London dropdown 
    
      Scenario: I’d like to develop my own action plan so that I can feel empowered to do something
    Given give many options
    When groups in E/S/W/N London dropdown

# Week 1: Design Week
- prototyping on figma
    -  building on the "crazy 8s" that we drew, we ear-marked our favourite frames from all of them respectively
    -  To inform our figma proto we made an "inspiration" page which acted as a mood board. This culminated in the including the following general themes,
        -  cartoons
        -  comics
        -  test-tubes
        -  LSx assets
        -  newspapers
        -  letters
        -  balloons
    - Brain-storming ideas was made easier by making large mind-map as a group. From this we came up with a fair number of the above themes 
    - A big (and latent) realisation which massively informed the design process was the concept of "action planning" as part of the specification given by the product owner. In realising that we were not explicitly handling this part of the spec we reframed our content accordingly.
    - The proto was also built gradually through a discriminative process. A frame would be designed, copied and improved upon, rinse repeat until all members of the group were satisfied. Frequently we would pair on a frame and source inspiration from one another's design = a nice, unforced synthesis 
- user testing 
- synthesis
