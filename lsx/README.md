The LSx Action Planner
===

## Beginners Guide
LSx works with schools and communities to monitor and take action on air pollution. They'd like to develop something that can digitalise and democratise data and information of air pollution.

```gherkin=
Feature: I don’t have data/haven’t done an experiment (yet)

  Scenario: I’m new to LSx and am keen to get involved
   Given I’d like to ‘see the invisible pollution’ so that I can get something done about it
    And provide info on data collection methods


  Scenario: I’d like to know the next steps so that I know what the best thing to do is
    Given SHARING is key
    And Experiments are a option but also ..
    And other people’s data

     Scenario: I’d like to see success stories so that I can feel confident/reassured/inspired
   And display stories where users falter

      Scenario: I’d like to connect with others locally so that I can share my findings and stay motivated
    Given hashtag on Twitter and Facebook?
    And groups in E/S/W/N London dropdown

      Scenario: I’d like to develop my own action plan so that I can feel empowered to do something
    Given give many options
    When groups in E/S/W/N London dropdown


```



```gherkin=
Feature: I have data


  Scenario:I want to understand more
    Given  I’d like to know what my data means so I can use it
    When It’s an indication of something
    And Input/visualise/interpret the data

Scenario: I’d like to know the limitations of this data
       And  Keep reassurance

  Scenario:  I’d like to compare my data
     And  Links to collected data

    Scenario:  I want to share my data
     And Hashtag(s)
     And Links to groups in different parts of Ldn (north,east,south,west)

# Week 1: Design Week
- prototyping on figma
    -  building on the "crazy 8s" that we drew, we ear-marked our favourite frames from all of them respectively
    -  To inform our figma proto we made an "inspiration" page which acted as a mood board. This culminated in the including the following general themes,
        -  cartoons
        -  comics
        -  test-tubes
        -  LSx assets
        -  newspapers
        -  letters
        -  balloons
    - Brain-storming ideas was made easier by making large mind-map as a group. From this we came up with a fair number of the above themes
    - A big (and latent) realisation which massively informed the design process was the concept of "action planning" as part of the specification given by the product owner. In realising that we were not explicitly handling this part of the spec we reframed our content accordingly.
    - The proto was also built gradually through a discriminative process. A frame would be designed, copied and improved upon, rinse repeat until all members of the group were satisfied. Frequently we would pair on a frame and source inspiration from one another's design = a nice, unforced synthesis
- user testing
- synthesis








--------------------



This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
